        <h1>Transportation</h1>
        <h2>The Atlanta Airport</h2>

        <p>The Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is likely how you came in, it’s the busiest airport in the entire world! There’s tons of stores located throughout all of the terminals, and it’s considered DELTA’s home-base. If going in-and-out of the city, this is absolutely the quickest way to do that.</p>
        <h2>MARTA</h2>
        <p>

        <p>MARTA is Atlanta’s main intercity travel option. There’s bus routes as well as the subway routes that run under and above ground at times. The latter are the most expansive, with many routes going all throughout the city linking the most important parts together. An important station to know is Five Points! It’s the centerpoint where all lines meet, and you can change from N/S to E/W direction!</p>
        <h2>Bird Scooters</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The Bird Scooters are a new mode of transportation around the city. You can connect with an app on your phone that locates the nearest scooter for you. It’s charged by usage of the scooter and definitely the best method for traveling shorter distances. This method is also electrically charged. With no gas being pumped, it’s a green alternative to inner city travel!</p>
