        <h1>Future</h1>
        <p>The future of Atlanta is very bright. Whether your a passerby or looking to settle in, Atlanta has much to offer! Expectations of the city’s growth are expected to continue, where it is estimated that by 2040 the city should add 2.5 million new residents, where 500,000 are located inside the city limits and the other 2 million are dispersed around the metro area.

Expectations of the city for growth in world class infrastructure, healthy livable communities, and competitive economy are on track thus far. Construction is an ongoing effort to make the city more sustainable in all of these areas.
